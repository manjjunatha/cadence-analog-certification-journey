# Semiconductor 101 – Cadence Certification

## Status
Completed (Badge Earned)

## Topics Covered

- Semiconductor physics fundamentals
- Intrinsic vs Extrinsic semiconductor materials
- PN junction formation and operation
- Drift and diffusion current mechanisms
- MOSFET structure and regions of operation
- Threshold voltage concept

## Key Technical Learnings

- Carrier concentration is directly influenced by doping levels.
- Drift current is caused by electric field, while diffusion current is caused by carrier concentration gradients.
- PN junction behavior determines diode characteristics and depletion width.
- MOSFET operation depends on gate voltage relative to threshold voltage.
- Device I–V characteristics directly impact gain and biasing in analog circuits.

## Concept-to-Circuit Connection

- Understanding threshold voltage helps in accurate bias point selection.
- Drift and diffusion mechanisms explain subthreshold conduction.
- MOSFET region of operation determines small-signal parameters (gm, ro).
- Device physics knowledge improves intuition during SPICE simulations.

## Technical Reflection

Before this module, my understanding of MOSFETs was mainly equation-driven.
After completing this module, I now better understand the physical
mechanisms behind device behavior, which strengthens my transistor-level
design intuition for analog CMOS circuits.

## Relevance to Analog Design

A strong foundation in semiconductor physics is essential for:
- Analog bias circuit design
- Current mirror implementation
- Gain stage analysis
- Stability and performance evaluation
